- Code for 3D numerical modelling (Finite-Element-Method) for studying the spatial distribution of stresses in the Earth required to generate big earthquakes.

- These experiments require a High-Performance Computing cluster.

- Underworld2, a Python API, is used for this task, which provides functionality for the modelling of Earth's dynamic processes. For scalability across multiprocessor platforms, Underworld2 leverages MPI (Message Passing Interface).
